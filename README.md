# Openfire-Plugin
Plugin for Openfire to extend the functionality of the server, for all of the features in https://github.com/cmmcmm9/Android-Chat-App

A Ktor embedded server was used to extend the functionality of Openfire. The Ktor server is listening for all offline messages, in either single or group chats, and will send a Firebase Cloud Message to the absent user to call them back online to retrieve their conversations. Ktor will also send a Firebase Message if a user updates their avatar, either for themselves or for a group chat, or a user updates their available times. The server handles all new user registration in the Openfire system, assuming they have been adequately registered via Firebase. The Ktor server will also handle syncing a user's Openfire roster with the phone numbers stored in their device. Lastly, it will manage all of the avatar changes and calls (with a GET request), either for a single user or a group chat.
